Hi, I’m Kate 👋

I build data science and geospatial analytics projects with an emphasis on aerospace, defense, and environmental applications. I like shipping end‑to‑end systems: data pipelines, ML models, and lightweight APIs.

    🌍 Focus: geospatial, remote sensing (SAR/EO), trajectory analytics, climate/wildlife
    ✈️ Domains: aerospace, defense (unclassified OSINT), environmental intelligence
    🛠️ Stack: Python, PyTorch, scikit‑learn, FastAPI, GeoPandas, Rasterio, xarray, PostGIS
    ☁️ Tools: Docker, DVC, Prefect, AWS/GCP, QGIS
    📫 Reach: open issues or connect on LinkedIn

Featured Projects
Wildlife Image Classification API

Production‑ready FastAPI + PyTorch service for wildlife species classification.

    Inference endpoint: /predict (image upload, top‑k)
    Tech: FastAPI, PyTorch, Docker, GitHub Actions
    Demo and docs: link to repo
    Highlights: transfer learning, CI pipeline, Docker image

Flood Mapping from Sentinel‑1 SAR

Rapid change detection for disaster response (pre/post event).

    Data: Sentinel‑1 GRD, FEMA polygons
    Methods: terrain correction, log‑ratio, Otsu + morphology, folium map
    Metrics: IoU, precision/recall, latency
    Repo: link to repo

ADS‑B Trajectory Anomaly Detection

Unsupervised aircraft trajectory clustering and anomalies.

    Data: OpenSky Network
    Methods: Kalman smoothing, HDBSCAN, feature engineering
    Outputs: interactive map + report
    Repo: link to repo

What I’m Working On

    Packaging reusable geospatial utilities (tiling, masking, CRS ops)
    Spatiotemporal modeling with xgboost and block cross‑validation
    Lightweight MLOps templates (DVC + Prefect + GitHub Actions)

Tech I Use

    Languages: Python, SQL
    ML/CV: PyTorch, torchvision, timm, scikit‑learn, xgboost, lightgbm
    Geo: GeoPandas, Rasterio, rioxarray, shapely, pyproj, folium, kepler.gl
    Data: pandas, xarray, duckdb, PostGIS
    Infra: Docker, GitHub Actions, AWS S3/Lambda/SageMaker, GCP
    Viz: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, altair

How I Work

    Reproducible: pyproject/environment.yml, Makefile, seeds, sample data
    Clear metrics: latency, throughput, cost, accuracy
    Ethics: dual‑use awareness, transparent limitations
