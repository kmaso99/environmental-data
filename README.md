# 🌍 EcoDataLab: Climate Launch Insights  
**Predictive Modeling of Launch-Linked Environmental Impact**  
_A project by Kate Mason_  

## 📌 Purpose  
EcoDataLab bridges aerospace analytics with planetary resilience. By modeling the environmental footprint of satellite launches, it connects geospatial analysis with global climate trends—supporting informed policy decisions and sustainable tech development.

## 🚀 Features  
- Power BI dashboards integrating launch schedules, fuel types, and climate overlays  
- Python modules for emissions estimates, scenario planning, and temporal modeling  
- SQL pipeline for extracting metadata from spaceflight and climate APIs  
- GIS-ready outputs compatible with ArcGIS and QGIS  
- Built-in ethics prompts based on Data4Good and Green Algorithms

## 🔧 Installation  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/katemason/ecodatalab.git  
cd ecodatalab  
pip install -r requirements.txt
