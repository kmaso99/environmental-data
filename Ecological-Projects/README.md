# 🚀 SpaceX Falcon 9 Landing Prediction
**Overview**

_This project applies machine learning techniques to predict successful landings of the SpaceX Falcon 9 first-stage booster. While rooted in aerospace, the workflow highlights data strategies that can be adapted to climate policy—such as classification modeling, feature engineering, and predictive analytics._

## 🔍 Climate Relevance
Demonstrates methods relevant to greenhouse gas forecasting, transportation emissions modeling, and spatially aware policy design.
Serves as a transferable template for understanding technological efficiency, resource optimization, and decision-making under uncertainty.

## 💻 Tech Stack
- Python: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- GridSearchCV for model tuning
- Confusion matrix and visualizations for interpretability

## 📊 Key Features

- Data wrangling and preprocessing

- Feature selection and transformation

- Multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees)

- Hyperparameter tuning via cross-validation

- Confusion matrix heatmaps for performance insight

## 🌱 Extension Opportunities

- Adapt modeling workflow to EPA emissions data

- Integrate geospatial layers for launch site analysis or regional emissions

- Extend classification to environmental outcomes (e.g., success of mitigation strategies)
